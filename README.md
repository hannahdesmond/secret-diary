### Secret Diary 

#### Practical for Makers Academy 

The aim of this practical was to test-drive the creation of a secret diary.

Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.

When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.

When the user locks the diary, by calling `lock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should, again, throw an error.
First organise it into one class only.

Then I reorganised it into classes with high cohesion.
